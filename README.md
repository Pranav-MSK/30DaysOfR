# 📘 30 Days of R — Learning Journey

Welcome to my 30 Days of R challenge!
This repository documents my learning journey as I explore R programming, practice real-world examples, and build a habit of coding regularly.

This challenge is progress-based, not calendar-based.
I may not code every single day, but I will complete 30 meaningful learning sessions and track them here.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Learn the fundamentals of R — including syntax, data structures, data wrangling, visualization, and basic statistical analysis — by completing 30 focused learning sessions.

---

## 🗂️ Structure

Each learning session has its own folder:
```graphsql
Day01/
Day02/
Day03/
...
Day30/
```

Inside the folder, you may find:
- `.R` scripts (practice code)
- `.Rmd` notebooks (notes, examples, analyses)
- datasets used for exercises
- any mini-projects built during the session

## 📅 Learning Progress

> Note: This is a progress-based learning log. Sessions may not be completed on consecutive days.

| Day | Topics Covered | Status |
|-----|----------------|--------|
| Day 01 | Syntax, Comments & Operators | ✅ |
| Day 02 | I/O, Variables & Data Types | ✅ |
| Day 03 | Control Structures & Functions | ✅ |
| Day 04 | Data Structures | ✅ |
| Day 05 | Plots & Charts | ✅ |
| Day 06 | Statistics | ✅ |
| Day 07 | — | ⏳ |
| … | … | … |


## 🧰 Tools Used
- `R`
- `RStudio`
- Tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2, readr, etc.)
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 💡 Why 30 Days?

A 30-session format keeps the challenge achievable and flexible.
There's no pressure to complete all days consecutively — the goal is consistency over time, not perfection.

After completing this challenge, I may continue with:

- 100 Days of R
- project-based learning
- data analysis case studies
- machine learning in R

## 📝 Notes

This repository is primarily for learning and practice.
If you’re also beginning R, feel free to use this structure as inspiration for your own learning journey.

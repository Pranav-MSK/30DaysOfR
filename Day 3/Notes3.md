## Day 3 - R Fundamentals 
### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements in R are used to make decisions based on conditions. 
They allow a program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is TRUE or FALSE.
- Conditions must return TRUE or FALSE
- Use if for single conditions
- Use if–else for two choices
- Use if–else if–else for multiple choices
- Use ifelse() for vectors

Conditional statements are essential for decision-making in R programs. 
They help control the flow of execution based on logical conditions.

### Looping Statements

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

R has two loop commands:
- while loops
- - execute a set of statements as long as a condition is TRUE


- for loops
- - it is used for iterating over a sequence:

## Day 3 - R Fundamentals 
### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements in R are used to make decisions based on conditions. They allow a program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is TRUE or FALSE.
- Conditions must return TRUE or FALSE
- Use if for single conditions
- Use if–else for two choices
- Use if–else if–else for multiple choices
- Use ifelse() for vectors

Conditional statements are essential for decision-making in R programs. They help control the flow of execution based on logical conditions.
